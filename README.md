# Job Market Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of job market trends by analyzing a dataset from a job portal. It utilizes SQL queries to extract job-related data from a MySQL database and Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud to process, analyze, and visualize the data. The goal of this project is to gain insights into job titles, industries, functional areas, key skills, and salary distributions.
